  -Police Unions? BAD
  -"But the harshest criticism has come from Bay Area police unions. The head of the San Francisco police association lambasted his “naïveté” and “total lack of sensitivity,” and called on the 49ers to “denounce” the gesture. The Santa Clara police union said that its members, many of whom provide security at 49ers games, might refuse to go to work if no action was taken against Kaepernick."
  -Police unions have done quite a good job at ensuring police have high pay (amongst civil servants) have due process rights and aren't subject to arbitrary discipline. They have contributed to policies such as officers not being interrogated immediately following use of force incidients and allowing for disciplinary records to be purged every 3 to 5 years.
	-"... thanks to union contracts, even officers who are fired can frequently get their jobs back. Perhaps the most egregious example was Hector Jimenez, an Oakland police officer who was dismissed in 2009, after killing two unarmed men, but who then successfully appealed and, two years later, was reinstated, with full back pay."
	-Police unions have fought tooth and nail for years against reform, such as name  badges, the use of body cameras and have "protested proposals to document racial profiling and to track excessive-force complaints" as well as lobbying to keep disciplinary records sealed.
	-"Across the nation, unions have led the battle to limit the power of civilian-review boards, generally by arguing that civilians are in no position to judge the split-second decisions that police officers make. Earlier this year, Newark created a civilian-review board that was acclaimed as a model of oversight. The city’s police union immediately announced that it would sue to shut it down."

	-Police Unions? REALLY BAD
	-Research finds that access to collective bargaining trends with higher officer compensation with a "substantial increase in police killings of civilians over the medium to long run...many of whom the overwhelming majority are non-white."

	-"BUTLER: Many police unions are extremely influential. Some spend millions of dollars a year electing lawmakers and helping to support mayors and district attorneys who support their agenda. For a long time in the United States, the politics around law and order have been, get tough on crime. That's certainly the FOP's line, and a lot of politicians have gone along with that. In this moment, that might be starting to change."

	-"ABSTRACT: The debate over possible bias in the use of deadly force has recently been exacerbated by highly publicized killings of African American males around the country. While much research has been conducted examining police behavior, little has been done to investigate the impact of race on police behavior. This article aims to answer this question: are white police officers more likely to use lethal force on minority suspects or people of a specific race? To answer this question, the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the United States in 2014 and 2015. They find that although minority suspects are disproportionately killed by police, white officers appear to be no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than nonwhite officers."
