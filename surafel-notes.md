#### Authors
Both David Weisburd and Rosann Greenspan have degrees and positions in acredited universities relating to criminology. Edwin E. Hamilton  and Kellie A. Bryant has been in been cited in a few publications related to policing and criminology. Hubert Williams was the president of the National Police Foundation. Served as both an officer, police director, and worked with the FBI, CIA, and Homeland Securty. He thoroughly practices "evidence-based policing" and has collaborated with police departments to participate in studies.

#### Organization
Study conducted by the National Police Foundation, a national, non-profit organization dedicated to innovating policing through research. They are acredited with well-done research and experiments on policing. They are cited often and are called to investigate, and even indict, officers/departments for cases of police brutality. From a purist perspective, the sponsors list bring concerns over a conflict of interest since 3/5 of the sponsors provides solutions to police departments. However, their actions are credited to practicing their mission statement.

#### Summary
For the past three decades, police have seen themseleves turning from military and professional engagement with the community to working with the community as partners to combat crime and disorder. Given the movement towards community oriented policing. this study aims to identify police officers attitudes towards, not just policing, but the role the police and their use of authority. The study uses a phone survey from a representative sample of 924 police officers in a city of about 350,000 people. The results of of are, quote:

> American police believe that extreme cases of police abuse of  authority occur infrequently. However, a substantial minority of officers believe that it's sometimes necessary to use more force than is legally allowable.
> Despite strong support for norms recognizing the boundaries of police authority, officers revealed that it is not unusual for police to ignore improper conduct by their fellow officers.
> American police believe that training and education programs are effective means of preventing police from abusing authority. They also argue that their own department takes a “tough stand” on the issue of police abuse. Finally, they argue that a department’s chief and first-line supervisors can play an important role in preventing abuse of authority.
> Police officers believe that the public and the media are too concernedwith police abuses of authority.
> American police officers support core principles of community policing; they generally believe that community policing reduces or has no impact on the potential for police abuse.
> A  majority of African-American police officers believe that police treat whites better than African-Americans and other minorities, and that police officers are more likely to use physical force against minorities or the poor. Few white police officers, however, share these views.

#### Findings
The results suggest that there is a gap between officers' attitudes and behavior regardling excessive force and the code of silence.

Officers generally disapprove of the use of excessive force and the code of silence, and a majority do not believe that officers are not using excessive force. The only notable outlier to the consensus is when controlling someone who physically assaults an officer (almost 25%). Almost 35% of officers feel that departmental rules should be stricter than required by law. A significantly small percentage of officers do not believe that physical force is acceptable to verbal abuse. However, 22% believe that officers somtimes, often, or always use more force than necessary to make an arrest, with 62.4% saying they seldom do. Even though officers overwhelmingly that physical force in response to verbal abuse is not allowed, almost 15% of officers thought that officers did so anyways. 

Even though 80% of police in the weighted survey did not think the code of silence was a necessary part of policing, nearly 25% of officers say that whistleblowing is not worth it and 67.4% of officers believe that it's not unusual for officers to give whistleblowers the "cold-shoulder". 51.8% of officers believe that it is not uncommon for officers to turn a "blind eye" on police misconduct. 61% of officers disagree that police *always* report serious violations of abuse of authority by fellow officers.

Given the scenario, "An officer has a handcuffed suspectat his desk while he fills out the necessary paperwork. With noprovocation from the officer, the suspect suddenly spits in the faceof the officer. The officer immediately pushes the suspect in the facecausing the suspect to fall from the chair onto the floor.”: 
    * 35.8% of officers believe this is serious behavior.
    * 28.5% of officers most likely wouldn't report officers who engaged in this behavior.
    * 59.6% of officers believe that other officers most likely wouldn't report officers who engaged in this behavior.

Here are some condensed statistics and notes from the study:
    * On average. the number of officers who hold the opinion that extra-legal factors (attitude, race, income) do not influence their behavior are nearly evenly divided.
    * 62.9% disagree with that citizen review boards are an effective means for preventing police misconduct. 
    * Most officers believe that most people respect the police and that the relationship between officers and citizens is very good.
    * Most officers believe that the public and media are too concered with police brutality.
    * 94.6% of police say that internal review boards are not in favor of police.
    * A significant majority believe that a police chief, supervisors, and effective methods of supervision can prevent officers from abusing their authority.
    * About 42.9% believe that community policing decreases the risk, number, and severity of excessive force indcidents.

#### Summary

This research measures police integrity in police agencies across the US to analyze police corruption at an organization level rather than an individual level. It also aims to determine the credibility of the "bad apple" theory. The researchers asked about 3,200 police officers in 30 police agencies across the US for their opinions on hypothetical cases to measure the seriousness of the case and the behavior that case provokes. The paper asserts that curbing policing corruption through an organizaional approach rather than the traditional individual/"bad apple" approach yields greater benefits and is more effective to research; "Unlike the administrative/individual approach, an organizational/occupational culture approach to the study of police integrity involves questions of fact and opinion that can be explored directly, without arousing the resistance that direct inquiries about corrupt behavior are likely to provoke."

The noteworthy results are:

> A majority of police officers said that they would not report a fellow officer who had engaged in what they regarded as less serious misconduct (for example, operating an off-duty security business; accepting free gifts, meals, and discounts; or having a minor accident while driving under the influence of alcohol.
> At the same time, most police officers indicated that they would report a colleague who stole from a found wallet or a burglary scene, accepted a bribe or kickback, or used excessive force on a car thief after a foot pursuit.
> The survey found substantial differences in the environment of about integrity among the 30 agencies in the sample.

#### Findings

Nothing out of what's expected. The officers held opinions on police conduct that run parallel what what most people would also believe. The noteworthy exception to this rule, however, is that officers considered the coverup of a DUI accident involving a police officer a minor offense.

Note that this is not a representative sample of police opinions. It only serves to test the methodology of analyzing police behavior at an orgnazational level to diseminate the "bad apple" argument.

### Findings

Blocked behind a request-wall. The abstract and references provide the critical conclusions we need:

>This paper examines the 'Blue Code of Silence' and its contribution to police corruption. After offering evidence for the existence of such a code, the paper locates the origins of the code in the work and culture of policing. The paper also examines cases, commission reports and an original case study to understand how the code is reinforced. Based on 'participant observation' research of the New York County Prosecutor's Official Corruption Unit, the paper also illustrates how the code impedes investigations by police overseers. Finally, the paper discusses various measures to address the code of silence.
